   <h1> Our promise </h1> 
   <h2> 
1. Nothing is lost in the universe
2. Everything Changes
3. The Law of Cause and Effect
   </h2>
     <p>
In Buddhism, the law of karma, says "for every event that occurs, there will follow another event
whose existence was caused by the first, and this second event will be pleasant or unpleasant
according as its cause was skillful or unskillful." Therefore, the law of Karma teaches that the
responsibility for unskillful actions is borne by the person who commits them. 
After his enlightenment, the Buddha went to the Deer Park near the holy city of Benares and shared
his new understanding with five holy men. They understood immediately and became his disciples.
This marked the beginning of the Buddhist community. For the next forty-five years, the Buddha
and his disciples went from place to place in India spreading the Dharma, his teachings. Their
compassion knew no bounds; they helped everyone along the way, beggars, kings and slave girls.
At night, they would sleep where they were; when hungry they would ask for a little food.
Wherever the Buddha went, he won the hearts of the people because he dealt with their true
feelings. He advised them not to accept his words on blind faith, but to decide for themselves
whether his teachings are right or wrong, then follow them. He encouraged everyone to have
compassion for each other and develop their own virtue: "You should do your own work, for I can
teach only the way."
Once, the Buddha and his disciple Ananda visited a monastery where a monk was suffering from a
contagious disease. The poor man lay in a mess with no one looking after him. The Buddha himself
washed the sick monk and placed him on a new bed. Afterwards, he admonished the other monks:
"Monks, you have neither mother nor father to look after you. If you do not look after each other,
who will look after you? Whoever serves the sick and suffering, serves me."
After many such cycles, if a person releases their attachment to desire and the self, they can attain
Nirvana. This is a state of liberation and freedom from suffering.

  <h1>Reddits Advice To building muscle </h1> 
  <p>Building muscle is NOT only about lifting weights and eating a lot.

Building muscle is ALL about progression. You need food for progression, not for building muscle. Progression is limited by your body's adaptability - eating more will not cause you adapt faster. You just need to eat enough to adapt, which is slightly more than you would need to just recover from the workouts (get back to baseline). 200-300 calories extra per day. A potato and a chicken breast.

The body's adaptability is highly individual - but that's what leads to muscles, nothing else. Some people think it's your effort, but that's just a lie pushed by the supplement industry.

You can kill yourself in the weight room and eat like a pig, and never progress at a rate that matches your efforts (or weight gain). You're limited by your natural maximum rate of progression. If you have naturally low adaptability (meaning your body is only okay adding a little bit of muscle per workout), then killing yourself will only make your body recover and rebuild all the damaged muscles, and add that standard amount on top of it. You can't run away from that standard amount. It's determined by your hormone levels. Doing heavy lifts does increase your testosterone, but no one has ever proved that all that definitively (your body has very strong regulation systems that monitor hormone levels, it won't go above its accepted range naturally) i.e. Make effort when you lift, but do it so that you can still progress - you might have to actually hold back some days, because, with experience, you will learn to separate good stress from bad stress. Killing yourself is always bad stress. You should feel kinda good. Tired but good.

There is also a gene that controls how much muscle your body is okay with (both growth rate and total extra mass).

Now, let me say a few things about progression.

There are many different kinds of ways you can progress in a weight room.

You can lift more weight with the same rep scheme. You can do more reps per set with the same weight. You can do more sets, with same weight and same reps. You can do the same exact workout in less time. You can lift more weight, per week. Etc. Etc.

The point is, do your workout. Next time come back and beat your numbers. In my opinion, focus on other progressions than weight. Weight-only progression mindset leads to stagnation. Think about it. If you add even 1lb to your working weight each week, that would work out to be 500 lbs in ten years. No one has even lifted 500lb in all lifts, even for one repetition (if you're talking bodybuilding lifts), much less for several. And all the fitness experts recommend you raise your weight by 5lbs each week. That's just asinine. Plenty of people work out for 10+ years. No one gets that strong. It's because getting stronger (in low repetitions like Strong Lifts etc.) for muscle size is a lie. Those people have just picked their thing to preach, and they don't want to tell you what I've just told you - no point in reading their blogs, no point buying their supplements - your body has a natural progression/growth rate, that's very slow (sorry). Work out for 10 years, you will grow the same amount of muscles, regardless if you kill yourself all that time, or just do enough but not too much. Everyone in the industry wants you to blame yourself for lack of effort, or lack of good program, or lack of nutrition, and look to them for advice. They make money that way, and they can't tell you what I just told you, since I don't give a fuck.

Go for other progressions, don't chase weight. Right now, for example, my favorite progression is this: Pick 1 exercise per muscle group, and do it twice a week. Start with a weight that you can do for 50 reps across 5 sets, and bring that weight up to 100 reps across 5 sets, no time limit on rest periods. That should keep you busy for a while. And it will be anything but easy

You can do anything, as long as it's a measurable progression. Choose the progression type your body responds best to </p>

  <h1>What we can Provide For you</h1>
  <p>was started in 2008 with the single goal of providing easy-to-follow comparisons of complex telco service products, so people can get better mobile phone and internet plans.

Telecommunications is a complicated, confusing and constantly changing category. There are so many providers and plans, it’s easy to get lost, easy to make a mistake and difficult to know who to trust. Many people are on plans that aren’t best for them, some continue to use out-of-date plans, while others don’t even know what plan they are on.

The way we see it, you shouldn’t have to be a genius to make a great cell phone plan or internet provider choice. That’s why we put the work in to provide the facts, figures and tools so that our users can choose the connection and carrier that’s right for them.

We aim to provide an accurate, independent and comprehensive service. Our users deserve to have certainty and confidence in their choices. Since day one, we’ve always run a broad panel of service providers in our comparison engine, putting the most recognisable brands in the market side by side, regardless of commercial relationship.

That said, it’s practically impossible to run every single product and provider in a category as there can be many thousands of small providers who frequently come and go. We consistently maintain thousands of active products in our databases so consumers see a strong cross section of the market in their search results. Additionally, we guarantee to always include the top 10 service providers in each product category (and we always try to include more than that). Typically the top ten service providers typically cover 80% or more of the products sold in each vertical

Commercial Relationships
Comparison sites aren’t financially viable without some commercial relationships in place. In our business, wireless and internet providers are interested in receiving referrals to their websites from our comparison engine. Typically our users are quite serious about buying comparing and purchasing products so this works well for everyone.

A commercial partner can get three things from WhistleOut (examples are listed below).

Referrals to purchase a product via a 'go to site' or phone number
Featured Results which offers the ability to list in a limited sponsored section at the top of the organic results tables
Data about their market share in the comparison process
We do include service providers on our site who are not our commercial partners. We do this so that our users can always see a fair representation of the market. For those providers, we will show the provider's best matched product against the user's search request in the organic search results. Importantly these results won't show a referral link if a commercial agreement in not in place with the carrier, however it is important to note that the position in the table will not be altered if there is a referral link or not. These products are still audited and maintained by our team with the same regularity and attention to detail as every other service provider in our database.

Are There Service Providers That We Don’t Compare?
We can't cover all products in the market as the product maintenance burden is too large, but we always endeavour to include at least the top ten service providers and usually many more. We maintain pricing combinations (deals, promotions, products, fees) for the thousands of products in our database.

Analysis Paralysis
We're also aware that showing too many products can be a little confronting for some users, and might make browsing the results seem like a daunting task for them. We endeavour to make the results as accurate and comprehensive as we can, while making them easy to follow. To aid this process we include filter options and navigation tabs with each set of query results so users can best hone in on the results most suitable to them.

Guidelines for Comparison Sites
Each country has a different level of maturity with comparison sites. As the business was originally founded in Australia, we're very familiar with the guidelines from The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the guidelines set for Comparison Sites. WhistleOut strives to adhere to those guidelines. The ACCC has three key principles for comparison sites to adhere to:

Principle 1: Facilitate honest, like-for-like comparisons
Principle 2: Be transparent about commercial relationships
Principle 3: Clearly disclose who and what is being compared
It is reasonable for consumers to expect that comparator websites provide access to information that is representative of the range of offers available in a certain sector. Consumers are also likely to seek comparator websites that cover a greater proportion of the market. As such, if operators do not appropriately inform consumers who or what is being compared, any purchasing decisions may be based on a distorted view of the market. Failure to make accurate or adequate disclosure about the nature or extent of the comparison service, including market coverage, may involve misleading or deceptive conduct, including by omission, and the making of false or misleading representations.

If you believe we are falling short in any of these areas, please contact us.

Comparison Sites vs Brokers / Agents
Many businesses call themselves comparison sites but are not actually consumer search engines. Instead, these type of sites only list products they earn commissions from. WhistleOut is not a broker / agent and does not sell any of the products compared on the site. We provide a powerful research tool that helps consumers find the best phone and internet plans for them. Users can then buy their preferred product from the service provider if they choose to.

Issues with Comparison Sites
WhistleOut has always believed in delivering a broad set of results where users can compare the prices and features of both big and small service providers in one place, so their products can be put to the test. Consumers are entitled to a fair comparison and need a way to get past marketing claims to see the differences between products stacked side-by-side.

In the UK, comparison sites were accused of misleading conduct for only showing products they sold or had commercial deals with, misleading consumers and hurting the industry. UK comparison sites are now forced to show a far wider spread of commercial and non-commercial results </p>
